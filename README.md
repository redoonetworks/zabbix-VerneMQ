# zabbix-verneMQ
Template to monitor VerneMQ from Zabbix  

Currently in development and will be exented, after script is created for that.  

Template loads Prometheus metrix, generated from VerneMQ server.  
It use the IP from Zabbix Host to read Metrix. So you need to make add a secure way to pull values and prevent access from public.
